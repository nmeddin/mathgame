This math game idea was a group effort

Thooba focused on creating the game, and designing the website

Jessica focused on implementing design. She also was able to implement the math function, which then finished our game

The website is an original design, but inspired by Star Wars. The game idea was original but code was pulled from online as specified in resources.
